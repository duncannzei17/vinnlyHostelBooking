           Vinnyl Hostel Booking is wholly committed towards protecting its users and also the personal data relating to its owners. It ensures the provided data which is submitted by both parties, students and those offering accommodation, is fully safe and secure. Personal data submitted by applicants during booking is only submitted to the appropriate property owner thus helping to mitigate frauds and cons. This goes a long way in enhancing trust between the property owners and users as full identity of the client is clearly stated and gives the VHB evidence of matching a particular client to a particular property owner. Personal information such as phone numbers assists VHB in times of feedback while trying to reach clients and helping them submit a successful booking. The same personal data is also used as a form of evidence that a client really used the VHB website to place a booking and this could prove useful at times where complaints or disputes might arise thus enabling an amicable resolution of the latter. Identity card numbers and student registration numbers of current learning institutions are used in verifying whether a VHB user is sincere and honest with the information they provided and such verification is carried out through government databases and institution databases.
